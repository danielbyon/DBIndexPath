                   DBIndexPath is a simple wrapper struct around an NSIndexPath, to make it 
                   possible to define an index path enum and switch on its cases. This is 
                   especially useful in UITableViewDataSource/UITableViewDelegate methods, where
                   you might execute different code depending on which row you are dealing with.
